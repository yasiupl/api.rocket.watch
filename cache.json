It was formerly operated by Lockheed Martin and is now operated by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with Boeing. Each Atlas V rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine burning kerosene and liquid oxygen to power its first stage and an American-built RL10 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to power its Centaur upper stage. The RD-180 engines are provided by RD Amross, while Aerojet Rocketdyne provides both the RL10 engines and the strap-on boosters used in some configurations. The standard payload fairing sizes are 4 or 5 meters in diameter and of various lengths. Fairings sizes as large as 7.2 m in diameter and up to 32.3 m in length have been considered.

GRAU index 14A14, is the collective designation for the 21st-century version of the Russian Soyuz rocket. In its basic form, it is a three-stage carrier rocket for placing payloads into low Earth orbit. The first-stage boosters and two core stages feature uprated engines with improved injection systems, compared to the previous versions of the Soyuz. Digital flight control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to be launched from a fixed launch platform, whereas the launch platforms for earlier Soyuz rockets had to be rotated as the rocket could not perform a roll to change its heading in flight.\r\n\r\nThe Soyuz 2.1b represents the latest development stage of the proven rocket.\r\n\r\nIt uses the new RD-0124 engines in the first three stages, coupled with an improved injection system that significantly boosts the performance of the Soyuz.\r\nFurthermore, she wears a new, digital startup control system.\r\nThis will allow the Soyuz 2.1b to carry around 1.2 tonnes more payload into low earth orbit compared to its predecessor."}],"total":215,"count":27,"offset":27,"expire":1572082369588},"launch?mode=verbose&limit=20&status=1,2,5,6&offset=0":{"launches":[{"id":1999,"name":"Kuaizhou-1A |

The satellite is built on Orbital ATKs GEOStar-2e bus and carries 35 equivalent 36 MHz Ku-band transponders connected to three service areas.

MEV-1 (Mission Extension Vehicle-1) incorporates flight-proven technologies the company has used in its commercial satellite and space logistics businesses. After successfully completing a series of in-orbit tests, the MEV-1 will begin its mission extension service for Intelsat-901 satellite in the graveyard orbit. MEV-1 will relocate the satellite scheduled for the mission extension service, which is planned for a five-year period, after which Intelsat 901 will be place back into graveyard orbit. Intelsat will also have the option to service multiple satellites using the same MEV.\n\nMEV-1 is based on the company’s GEOStar-3 spacecraft bus platform. Controlled by the company’s satellite operations team, the MEV-1 uses a reliable, low-risk docking system that attaches to existing features on a customer’s satellite. The MEV-1 provides life-extending services by taking over the propulsion and attitude control functions. The vehicle has a 15-year design life with the ability to perform numerous dockings and undockings during its life span.","type":10,"wikiURL":"","typeName":"Communications","agencies":[],"payloads":[{"id":493,"name":"Eutelsat 5 West B"},{"id":494,"name":"MEV-1 (Mission Extension Vehicle-1)"}]}],"statuscode":3,"mission":"Eutelsat 5 West B & MEV-1","tolaunch":-1379717,"description":"Eutelsat 5 West B will replace the Ku-band capacity of Eutelsat 5 West A (formerly Stellat 5) satellite, a key digital infrastructure addressing predominantly French, Italian and Algerian broadcast markets.
